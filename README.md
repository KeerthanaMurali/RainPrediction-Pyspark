# RainPrediction-Pyspark

This assessment analyze rain data in Australia. Different machine learning algorithms can be used to model and predict rainfall in the Python using Apache Pyspark. The main outcomes achieved while applying these techniques were:

- Import pyspark and initialize Spark
- Load the dataset and print the schema and total number of entries
Delete columns from the dataset
Print the number of missing data in each column
Fill the missing data with average value and maximum occurrence value
Data transformation
Create the feature vector and divide the dataset
Apply machine learning classification algorithms on the dataset and compare their accuracy. Plot the accuracy as bar graph
Calculate the confusion matrix and find the precision, recall, and F1 score of each classification algorithm
